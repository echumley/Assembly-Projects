My small repository of assembly porograms written or modified for class assignments, because why else would I be writing in Assembly?

Guide on using x64 Amazon Linux as an Assembly coding workspace. Enjoy!

Steps:
* Install necessary dependencies *
sudo yum install gcc
sudo yum install gdb
sudo yum install nasm -y

* Create working directories *
mkdir assembly && cd assembly
mkdir hello-world && cd hello-world
touch hello.asm

* Assemble the program *
nasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o
ld -o hello hello.o

* Run the program *
./hello
