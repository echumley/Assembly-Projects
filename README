My small repository of assembly programs written or modified for class assignments, because why else would I be writing in Assembly?

Guide on using x64 Ubuntu Server as an Assembly coding workspace. Enjoy!

Steps:
* Install necessary dependencies *
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install gcc gcc-multilib gdb nasm -y

* Create working directories *
mkdir assembly && cd assembly
mkdir hello-world && cd hello-world
touch hello.asm

* Assemble the program *
nasm -f elf32 hello.asm -o hello.o
gcc -m32 -no-pie -o hello hello.o -nostartfiles

* Run the program *
./hello
